# Netlify Blobs for Video Storage Analysis

## Netlify Blobs Limitations:
- **5GB max file size** - Most of your videos are likely under this
- **No public pricing yet** - Still in beta
- **Optimized for "frequent reads, infrequent writes"** - Good for your use case
- **No bandwidth pricing mentioned** - Could be expensive

## Pros:
✅ Integrated with Netlify (where your site is hosted)
✅ No separate account needed
✅ Automatic CDN distribution
✅ 5GB per file is enough for most videos

## Cons:
❌ No public pricing (could be expensive)
❌ 35GB total might be costly
❌ Not specifically designed for video streaming
❌ Beta status = potential changes

## Alternative: Netlify Large Media (Git LFS)
- 2.5GB bandwidth/month on free tier
- $5/month per 50GB bandwidth pack
- Your 35GB videos = ~$20-30/month in bandwidth alone

## Better Alternative: Create a Hybrid Solution

1. **Keep high-priority videos on Netlify Blobs** (5-10GB)
   - Most viewed properties
   - Drone footage highlights
   
2. **Use Backblaze B2 for archive** (remaining 25GB)
   - $0.005/GB/month storage
   - Free bandwidth via Cloudflare
   
3. **Local server for development**
   - Immediate access
   - No upload needed

## Recommendation:
Since Netlify Blobs pricing is unknown and it's not optimized for large media files, I recommend:

1. **Immediate**: Set up a local file server for development
2. **Production**: Use Backblaze B2 + Cloudflare (under $1/month)
3. **Future**: Consider Netlify Blobs when pricing is clear

Would you like me to implement the local file server first so you can start using videos immediately?
