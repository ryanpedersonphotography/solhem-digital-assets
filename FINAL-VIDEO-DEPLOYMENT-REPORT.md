## Technical Achievements

1. **Overcame 6MB Function Limit**: Used Netlify CLI for direct blob uploads
2. **Automated Upload Process**: Created scripts for bulk video uploads
3. **Maintained Data Integrity**: All video references updated with blob keys
4. **Zero Downtime**: Deployed incrementally without service interruption

## What's Working Now

Visit https://real-estate-dam-1752199834.netlify.app and:
- Navigate to any property
- Click on Videos section
- Play videos directly in browser
- Download videos to local device
- Filter properties by video availability

## Scripts Created

1. `/scripts/upload-videos-simple.sh` - Upload videos for a single property
2. `/scripts/quick-deploy.sh` - Deploy changes to production
3. `/update-video-blob-keys.js` - Auto-update blob keys in property data
4. `/docs/VIDEO-UPLOAD-GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive upload documentation

## Cost Considerations

- **Current Storage**: ~35GB uploaded
- **Pricing**: Netlify Blobs is in beta (currently free)
- **Alternative**: If pricing becomes prohibitive, can migrate to:
  - Cloudinary (25GB free)
  - Backblaze B2 ($6/month for 1TB)
  - AWS S3 (pay-as-you-go)

## Maintenance Tasks

1. **Monitor Netlify Blobs Dashboard**: Check storage usage
2. **Watch for Pricing Updates**: Beta pricing may change
3. **Backup Strategy**: Consider backing up videos elsewhere
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Check streaming performance

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check what videos are uploaded
netlify blobs:list property-videos

# Upload new video manually
netlify blobs:set property-videos "property-id/type/filename.mp4" /path/to/video.mp4

# Deploy changes
